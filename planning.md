2. Wireframe: https://imgur.com/a/drrUb1Q
3. High level pseudocode:
- Define required constants
  - Colors of the cards in the “turned over” state (checkered)
  - Images of the 8 pairs present in the game
- Define required variables used to track the state of the game
  - Board
  - Randomized pairs
  - Time left
  - Wrong guesses remaining
- Store (cache) elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant.
  - Store the 16 elements that will represent the “cards” on the page
  - Store the "Start Game" button
  - Store the "Restart Game" button
- Upon loading the app should:
  - Initialize the state variables
    - Randomize the pair locations on the board
  - Render those values to the page
  - Wait for the user to click a “card”
- Handle the player cicking the "Start Game" button
  - Logic starting the timer once the "Start Game" button is clicked
- Handle a player clicking a “card”
- Handle a player clicking the “Restart Game” button
- Handle the timer starting once a “card” has been clicked
- Handle the “Wrong Guesses Remaining” counting down whenever the player chooses (clicks) a wrong guess
- Logic controlling the game ending once the timer is up
- Logic controlling the game ending once the player runs out of “wrong guesses”
- Game loop:
  - Player clicks “Start Game”
  - Timer begins
  - Player starts choosing cards in pairs on the board
  - If chooses wrong pair, “Wrong Guesses Remaining” gets reduced by 1
  - When wrong pair is chosen, choices are displayed for a certain amount of time and then go back to being hidden
  - Once all pairs are matched up, player wins game
  - Winning display message appears when players wins game
  - Player can choose to restart game at any time
